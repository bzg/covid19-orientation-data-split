#+title: COVID-19 orientation data split

This repository is a ad hoc utility to split a json dump into csv
files and a zip of the last week csv files.

Set =csv-output-dir= and =zip-output-dir= in [[file:src/core.clj][src/core.clj]].  Make sure
these directory actually exist.

Then run the tool like this:

: clj -m core /home/user/dump.ndjson
